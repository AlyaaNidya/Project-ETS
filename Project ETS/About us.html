                <p>
                Pizzo is an authentic pizza restaurant who serves since 1956. It all started with Giovanna Zia who decided to sell her homemade Pizza and later become a huge Hype in the 60's.
                as time passes, Pizzo grows into a big pizza restaurant and has more than 500 outlets around the world.

                <h2>How Authentic is Pizzo?</h2>
                <p>
                Our inventor, Giovanna Zia is a true italian and her recipes has been passed down for nearly 6 decades! Although some improvements are made along the way, the real recipe is left untouched and it's served as one of our special origin menu.

                <h2>Authentic? Is it still Halal?</h2>
                <p>
                Yes! Eversince we decided to open our branch outside of Europe we were faced with a lot of difficulties including Vegan and Halal matters. It is a shame that some pizza lovers out there can't try our delicious authentic pizza. So we decided to open a lot of Halal outlets and launched the Vegan menu for our dear customers.
                Since our special origin menu contains pork and we don't want our customers to miss out, we launched an alternative menu in which <b><i>all menu with bacon is replaced with beef bacon.</i></b>
